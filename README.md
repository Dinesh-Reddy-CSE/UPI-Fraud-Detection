## üìå Overview

With the rapid adoption of UPI in India, fraud detection has become critical for financial institutions and users alike. This project leverages historical transaction data to train classification models that can flag potentially fraudulent UPI transactions before they cause harm.

Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and deployed with a Flask API for easy integration.
