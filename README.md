# UPI Fraud Detection System üõ°Ô∏èüí≥

A Machine Learning-based system designed to detect fraudulent UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions in real-time. Built to enhance digital payment security by identifying suspicious patterns using supervised learning models.

---

## üìå Overview

With the rapid adoption of UPI in India, fraud detection has become critical for financial institutions and users alike. This project leverages historical transaction data to train classification models that can flag potentially fraudulent UPI transactions before they cause harm.

Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and deployed with a Streamlit API for easy integration.
